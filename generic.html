								<p>In 2011, the total number of men who chose to drive to work was 1,014,681. By 2016, the total number was 1,081,604, an increase of 66,923. The total male growth rate is 6.6%. In 2011, the total number of women who chose to drive to work was 792,667. By 2016, the total number was 871,310, an increase of 78,643. The total female growth rate was 9.9%. In 2011, the total number of people who chose to drive to work was 1,807,348. The total number of people in 2016 was 1,952,914, an increase of 145,566. The total growth rate is 8.1%.</p>
								<p>I separately analyzed the growth rate of women in New South Wales from 2011 to 2016, males and all people who choose to drive to work. From the comparison of the 3d data model in the map, we can find that the growth rate of females who choose to drive to work between 2011 and 2016 is lower than that of males.</p>
								<p>From 2011 to 2016, the population of New South Wales is growing and the economy is in good shape. People's pursuit of quality of life is constantly improving, and driving is a very fast and convenient way for most people to travel. Driving to work can avoid delays caused by train and bus delays.</p>

								<p>We can see from the figure that the number of male and female women who choose to drive to work is growing. This also reflects from the side that people who own cars are becoming more and more, and having a private car can bring more convenience to life. In other words, it not only saves time on the way to work, but also gives people more time to spend with their family or free time to be alone.</p>
