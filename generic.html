								<h3>Data Journalism</h3>
								<p>Data Journalism refers to a new type of news reporting based on data capture, mining, statistics, analysis and visualization. Data news has a qualitative and quantitative leap forward driven by Big Data technology. Data journalism is a new form of reporting that emerged with the advent of the data age.</p>
								<h3>"Two-thirds of Australians drive to work"</h3>
								<div class="image"><img src="images/116.PNG" width="500" height="750" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<p>According to a census, nearly two-thirds of Australians drive private cars to work, and nearly one-tenth of passengers rely on public transportation. There are 13.3 million registered vehicles in Australia, which is equivalent to one car per 1.37 people. At the same time, Australia's average car travels 12,881 kilometers a year, while all Australian vehicles drive 167 billion kilometers a year.</p>

								<p>The ability of the population to access services and employment is strongly influenced by transportation. The number of cars per household in New South Wales quantifies the accessibility of private transport and will be influenced by age structure and family type, which determines the number of adults; access to public transport; to shops, services, employment and education Distance; and family income. Based on these factors, car ownership can be seen as an indicator of the pros and cons, or a neutral socioeconomic indicator that affects the environment and quality of life.</p>
								<p>As you can see from the above pictures, the number of people driving to work as driver exceeds 55% of total employed people. From 2011 to 2016, the change of people driving to work as driver is less than 1% of total employed people. In 2016, men who drove to work as driver were more than 60% of total employed males, while women who chose to drive to work as driver were lower than 55% of total employed females. In terms of the proportion of the population, the proportion of women who choose to drive is lower than that of men. However, the change in women who choose to drive to work as driver from 2011 to 2016 is higher than that of men.</p>

								<h4>LATTE LINE</h4>

								<p>The hypothetical boundary (the Latte Line) drawn on the diagonal between Sydney Airport, Parramatta and the northwestern suburbs of Sydney has become the guiding principle for planning the future of the city. It is widely believed that the economic development of the northern part of the Latte Line is better than that of the South.</p>
								<p>According to the above picture, the proportion of people who choose to drive to work in the north of the latte line is slightly larger than the south. Because driving is a very important mode of transportation, this is a hard need for many people. So on this issue, the difference between the north and the south of the latte line is very small.</p>

								<p>Through color, we can judge that the number of men driving to work in 2016 is more than that of women.By the way, the growth rate of women is higher than that of men.</p>
								<p>From the map shows that from 2011-2016,the growth rate of people who from Coast Areas choose to drive to work as a driver is higher than the inland areas.This may be because the coastal population has a larger population base and is denser than the inland areas.</p>
								<p>In 2011, the total number of men who chose to drive to work was 1,014,681. By 2016, the total number was 1,081,604, an increase of 66,923. The total male growth rate is 6.6%. In 2011, the total number of women who chose to drive to work was 792,667. By 2016, the total number was 871,310, an increase of 78,643. The total female growth rate was 9.9%. In 2011, the total number of people who chose to drive to work was 1,807,348. The total number of people in 2016 was 1,952,914, an increase of 145,566. The total growth rate is 8.1%.</p>
								<p>I separately analyzed the growth rate of women in New South Wales from 2011 to 2016, males and all people who choose to drive to work. From the comparison of the 3d data model in the map, we can find that the growth rate of females who choose to drive to work between 2011 and 2016 is more than that of males.</p>
								<p>From 2011 to 2016, the population of New South Wales is growing and the economy is in good shape. People's pursuit of quality of life is constantly improving, and driving is a very fast and convenient way for most people to travel. Driving to work can avoid delays caused by train and bus delays.</p>
                                                                <div class="image"><img src="images/112.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<div class="image"><img src="images/222.jpg" width="500" height="400" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<p>The reason about why the white part appears on the map is that the central part of NSW is sparsely populated, and people's occupations are less demanding to drive to work than other areas.</p>
								<p>We can see from the figure that the number of male and female women who choose to drive to work is growing. This also reflects from the side that people who own cars are becoming more and more. Having a private car can bring more convenience for life. In other words, it not only saves time on the way to work, but also gives people more time to spend with their family or free time to be alone.</p>
