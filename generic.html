								<p>The ability of the population to access services and employment is strongly influenced by transportation. The number of cars per household in New South Wales quantifies the accessibility of private transport and will be influenced by age structure and family type, which determines the number of adults; access to public transport; to shops, services, employment and education Distance; and family income. Based on these factors, car ownership can be seen as an indicator of the pros and cons, or a neutral socioeconomic indicator that affects the environment and quality of life.</p>
								<p>As can be seen from the above figure, driving to work is the choice of more than 55 percent of the total number of people. However, the growth rate of people who drive to work as drivers is less than 1%. The number of men driving to work is 60% higher than that of the total male. The number of women who choose to drive to work is less than 55%. From the proportion of the number of people, the proportion of women driving to work is lower than that of men. However, the growth rate of women who drive to work from 2011 to 2016 is higher than that of men.</p>

								<h4>MPA ANALYSIS</h4>
								<p>In 2011, the total number of men who chose to drive to work was 1,014,681. By 2016, the total number was 1,081,604, an increase of 66,923. The total male growth rate is 6.6%. In 2011, the total number of women who chose to drive to work was 792,667. By 2016, the total number was 871,310, an increase of 78,643. The total female growth rate was 9.9%. In 2011, the total number of people who chose to drive to work was 1,807,348. The total number of people in 2016 was 1,952,914, an increase of 145,566. The total growth rate is 8.1%.</p>
								<p>I separately analyzed the growth rate of women in New South Wales from 2011 to 2016, males and all people who choose to drive to work. From the comparison of the 3d data model in the map, we can find that the growth rate of females who choose to drive to work between 2011 and 2016 is lower than that of males.</p>
								<p>From 2011 to 2016, the population of New South Wales is growing and the economy is in good shape. People's pursuit of quality of life is constantly improving, and driving is a very fast and convenient way for most people to travel. Driving to work can avoid delays caused by train and bus delays.</p>
                                                                <div class="image"><img src="images/112.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<div class="image"><img src="images/222.jpg" alt="" /></div><div class="content">
								<p>The reason why the white part appears on the map is that the central part of NSW is sparsely populated, and people's occupations are less demanding to drive to work than in other areas.</p>
								<p>We can see from the figure that the number of male and female women who choose to drive to work is growing. This also reflects from the side that people who own cars are becoming more and more, and having a private car can bring more convenience to life. In other words, it not only saves time on the way to work, but also gives people more time to spend with their family or free time to be alone.</p>
